// There are three related state types in this crate:
//
// - `TcpState` — This is the public-facing type for the TCP state. Its methods take shared or
//   mutable references. It contains a non-public `TcpStateEnum`.
// - `TcpStateEnum` — An enum of all individual TCP state types (ex: `ListeningState`,
//   `EstablishedState`). It implements the `TcpStateTrait` trait, so its methods usually take owned
//   objects and return owned objects.
// - `TcpStateTrait` — A trait implemented by each individual TCP state type, as well as the
//   `TcpStateEnum` enum that encapsulates all individual states. Its methods usually take owned
//   state objects and return owned `TcpStateEnum` objects.
